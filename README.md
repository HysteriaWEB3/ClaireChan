## Overview

**Claire Chan** is a real-time AI companion built for modern DeFi workflows.

This repository contains the full web platform powering **ClaireChan.io** — a terminal-grade interface where users can:

- Design and reason about AMM strategies  
- Generate and iterate on production-ready code  
- Interact with live DEX and perp infrastructure  
- Communicate with Claire via text, voice, and external agents  
- Build directly inside an AI-assisted environment  

This is not a demo.  
This is infrastructure.

## Core Philosophy

```txt
• no fake metrics
• no placeholder systems
• no dark patterns
• no UI noise
Everything in Claire Chan is designed to be:

Honest

Composable

Real-time

Production-oriented

The Claire Desktop Model

Claire is represented by a desktop-grade Live2D model, rendered directly in the UI.

Features

Full-body Live2D model

Smooth mouse tracking (head + body)

Physics-enabled motion (hair, clothing)

Subtle idle breathing and sway

Constrained rendering inside terminal-style frames

Non-intrusive (no pointer capture)

The model is not cosmetic — it is a persistent interface presence tied to system state, responses, and interaction context.

Companion Capabilities

Claire is designed as a multi-tool AI environment, not just a chat box.

Chat

Real-time AI responses

Context-aware DeFi reasoning

Code explanations and planning

Build Code

Next.js components

Solana scripts

Frontend and infra scaffolding

File-path aware outputs

AMM Lab

Fee strategy reasoning

Liquidity curve discussion

Protocol design drafts

Risk/edge analysis

Terminal

Command-style interactions

Build steps

Tooling outputs

Builder (Mini IDE)

Monaco-based editor

In-memory workspace

AI-assisted code generation

Exportable outputs

Voice Interaction

Claire supports real-time voice output using ElevenLabs TTS.

Server-side synthesis

Instant playback after responses

User-controlled toggle and volume

Designed for low-latency interaction

Voice is treated as a first-class interface, not an add-on.

Image Generation

Claire includes image generation using xAI (Grok):

Prompt-driven generation

Server-side API calls

No client-side key exposure

Integrated directly into the Companion tools

Used for:

Concept art

UI ideas

Visual references

Token imagery

DEX Hub

The /dex section functions as a live market hub, inspired by tools like DexScreener.

Features

Real-time market discovery (public APIs)

Token pages with charts

Community token listings

User-submitted metadata:

Token image

Banner

Website

Twitter

Telegram

Auth-gated posting and management

All displayed data is real or explicitly unavailable.
No mock prices. No fake volume.

Authentication

Claire Chan supports dual authentication:

Wallet Auth

Solana wallet connect

Message signing for identity

Required for DEX posting and staking actions

Account Auth

Username / email login

Secure password hashing

Session-based access

Both systems coexist cleanly and are UI-gated where required.

$CLAIRE Token

Claire Chan is powered by the $CLAIRE token on Solana.
