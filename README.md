## Overview

**Claire Chan** is a real-time AI companion built for modern DeFi workflows.

This repository contains the full web platform powering **ClaireChan.io** — a terminal-grade interface where users can:

- Design and reason about AMM strategies  
- Generate and iterate on production-ready code  
- Interact with live DEX and perp infrastructure  
- Communicate with Claire via text, voice, and external agents  
- Build directly inside an AI-assisted environment  

This is not a demo.  
This is infrastructure.

## Core Philosophy

• no fake metrics
• no placeholder systems
• no dark patterns
• no UI noise

Auth-gated posting and management

All displayed data is real or explicitly unavailable.
No mock prices. No fake volume.

Authentication

Claire Chan supports dual authentication:

Wallet Auth

Solana wallet connect

Message signing for identity

Required for DEX posting and staking actions

Account Auth

Username / email login

Secure password hashing

Session-based access

Both systems coexist cleanly and are UI-gated where required.

$CLAIRE Token

Claire Chan is powered by the $CLAIRE token on Solana.

The Claire Desktop Model

Claire is represented by a desktop-grade Live2D model, rendered directly in the UI.

Features

Full-body Live2D model

Smooth mouse tracking (head + body)

Physics-enabled motion (hair, clothing)

Subtle idle breathing and sway

Constrained rendering inside terminal-style frames

Non-intrusive (no pointer capture)

The model is not cosmetic — it is a persistent interface presence tied to system state, responses, and interaction context.

Claire Chan is under active development.
Features are added incrementally with stability as the top priority.
